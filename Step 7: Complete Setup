Note - If you are not comfortable using terminal to create the config.php file that needs to be created when going through the installer, you should temporarily make the webroot writable by doing the following:
>sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/moodle

After you have ran the installer and you have moodle setup, you NEED to revert permissions so that it is no longer writable using the below command.
>sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/html/moodle

Open your browser and go to http://IP.ADDRESS.OF.SERVER/moodle
example: http://192.168.142.12/moodle

Follow the prompts:

Change the path for moodledata
/var/moodledata

Database Type
Choose: mysqli

Database Settings
Host server: localhost

Database: moodle

User: moodledude (the user you created when setting up the database)

Password: passwordformoodledude (the password for the user you created)

Environment Checks

Next next next...
follow prompts and confirm installation

Create a Site Administrator Account
Create your moodle user account which will have site administrator permissions.

The password you select has to meet certain security requirements.

Don't Forget: If you made the webroot writable, revert permissions
>sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/html/moodle
