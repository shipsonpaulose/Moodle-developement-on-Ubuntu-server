After installing Moodle you should set the system paths, this will provide better performance VS not setting them. Each entry in Moodle will have it's explanation.

Navigate, on the moodle webpage, to Site Administration > Server > System Paths

Input the following;

Path to Du: /usr/bin/du

Path to Apsell: /usr/bin/aspell

Path to dot: /usr/bin/dot

Save Changes


Optional if you do not already have an AntiVirus Solution
We also installed ClamAV in Step 3 so we need to set the path in Moodle

1st Create the Quarantine Directory
>sudo mkdir /var/quarantine

Change Ownership
>sudo chown -R www-data /var/quarantine

Navigate to Site Administration > Plugins > Antivirus plugins > Manage antivirus plugins

Enable ClamAV antivirus

Click on Settings

Set the proper settings

Save changes

In previous Moodle branches: Check "Use ClamAV on uploaded files" ClamAV Path : /usr/bin/clamscan Quarantine Directory : /var/quarantine

Save Changes
